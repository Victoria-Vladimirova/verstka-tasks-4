                    <h2>Lifting Weights, Twice a Week, May Aid the Brain</h2>
                </header>
                <div class="content">
                    <p class="first-p">
                        Exercise is good for the brain. We know that. But most stud&shy;ies of
                        exercise and brain health have focused on the ef&shy;fects of running,
                        walking or oth&shy;er aer&shy;obic activ&shy;ities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now a new experi&shy;ment suggests that light resistance train&shy;ing may
                        also slow the age-related shrink&shy;ing of some parts of our brains.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our brains are, of course, dynam&shy;ic organs, adding and shedding
                        neu&shy;rons and connections through&shy;out our lifetimes. They remodel
                        and re&shy;pair them&shy;selves constantly, in fact, in response to our
                        lifestyles, including whether and how we exercise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But they remain, like the rest of our bod&shy;ies, vulnerable to the
                        passage of time. Many neu&shy;ro&shy;logical stud&shy;ies have found
                        that, by late mid&shy;dle age, most of us have be&shy;gun
                        devel&shy;op&shy;ing age-related holes or le&shy;sions in our brains’
                        white mat&shy;ter, which is the ma&shy;te&shy;rial that connects and
                        passes messages be&shy;tween differ&shy;ent brain regions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These le&shy;sions are usu&shy;ally asymptomat&shy;ic at first; they show
                        up on brain scans before some&shy;one no&shy;tices any waning of his or her
                        mem&shy;o&shy;ry or think&shy;ing skills. But the le&shy;sions can widen and
                        mul&shy;ti&shy;ply as the years go by, shrink&shy;ing our white mat&shy;ter
                        and af&shy;fecting our think&shy;ing. Neu&shy;ro&shy;logical stud&shy;ies
                        have found that old&shy;er people with many le&shy;sions tend to have worse
                        cognitive abilities than those whose white mat&shy;ter is rel&shy;atively
                        intact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A few encour&shy;aging past stud&shy;ies have suggested that reg&shy;ular,
                        moderate aer&shy;obic exercise such as walking may slow the progres&shy;sion
                        of white mat&shy;ter le&shy;sions in old&shy;er people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But Teresa Liu-Ambrose, a pro&shy;fessor of phys&shy;ical thera&shy;py and
                        di&shy;rector of the Aging, Mobility, and Cognitive Neu&shy;ro&shy;science
                        Lab&shy;oratory at the Uni&shy;versity of British Columbia in Vancouver,
                        wondered whether oth&shy;er types of exercise would like&shy;wise be
                        ben&shy;e&shy;ficial for white mat&shy;ter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In partic&shy;ular, she was inter&shy;ested in weight train&shy;ing, because
                        weight train&shy;ing strengthens and builds muscles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our muscles, like our brains, tend to shrink with age, af&shy;fecting how we
                        move. Puni&shy;er muscle mass generally results in slower, more-unsteady
                        walking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More surpris&shy;ing, changes in gait with aging may indicate and even
                        con&shy;tribute to dec&shy;lines in brain health, including in our white
                        mat&shy;ter, sci&shy;entists think.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <div><img src="images/TLiuAmbrose.jpg" alt=""></div>
                        <div class="image-title">Dr. Liu-Ambrose</div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        But if so, Dr. Liu-Ambrose thought, then weight train&shy;ing, which
                        strengthens and builds muscle, might be expected to al&shy;ter that
                        process and po&shy;tentially keep aging brains and bod&shy;ies
                        health&shy;i&shy;er.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To test that idea, she and her col&shy;leagues turned to a large group of
                        generally healthy women be&shy;tween the ages of 65 and 75 who already were
                        enrolled in a brain health study that she was leading. The women had had at
                        least one brain scan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the new study, which was pub&shy;lished this month in The Journal of the
                        American Ge&shy;riatrics Society, the sci&shy;entists ze&shy;roed in on 54
                        of the women, whose scans showed exis&shy;t&shy;ing white mat&shy;ter
                        le&shy;sions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The sci&shy;entists tested the women’s gait speed and stability, then
                        randomly as&shy;signed them to one of three groups.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some began a super&shy;vised, once-weekly program of light up&shy;per- and
                        lower-body weight train&shy;ing. A sec&shy;ond group under&shy;took the
                        same weight-train&shy;ing rou&shy;tine but twice per week. And the third
                        group, acting as a con&shy;trol, started a twice-weekly reg&shy;imen of
                        stretch&shy;ing and bal&shy;ance train&shy;ing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All of the women con&shy;tinued their as&shy;signed exercise rou&shy;tines
                        for a year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the end of that time, their brains were scanned again and their walking
                        ability re-as&shy;sessed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The results were al&shy;ternately sobering and stirring. The women in the
                        con&shy;trol group, who had con&shy;centrated on bal&shy;ance and
                        flexibility, showed worrying progres&shy;sion in the number and size of the
                        le&shy;sions in their white mat&shy;ter and in the slowing of their gaits.
                    </p>
                    <p>So did the women who had weight trained once per week.</p>
                    <p>
                        But those who had lifted weights twice per week displayed signif&shy;icantly
                        less shrinkage and tat&shy;tering of their white mat&shy;ter than the
                        oth&shy;er women. Their le&shy;sions had grown and mul&shy;ti&shy;plied
                        somewhat, but not nearly as much.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They also walked more quickly and smoothly than the women in the
                        oth&shy;er two groups.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These find&shy;ings suggest that weight train&shy;ing can
                        ben&shy;e&shy;ficially change the struc&shy;ture of the brain, but that
                        <q>a minimum thresh&shy;old of exercise needs to be achieved</q>,
                        Dr.Liu-Ambrose said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vis&shy;iting the gym once per week is prob&shy;a&shy;bly
                        in&shy;suf&shy;ficient. But twice per week may suffice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Howev&shy;er, this experi&shy;ment did not closely exam&shy;ine whether
                        differ&shy;ences in the women’s white mat&shy;ter trans&shy;lated into
                        meaningful differ&shy;ences in their ability to think, al&shy;though Dr.
                        Liu-Ambrose and her col&shy;leagues hope to study that issue soon, as well
                        as whether men’s brains respond similarly to weight train&shy;ing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They also hope to learn more about just how weight train&shy;ing
                        af&shy;fects white mat&shy;ter. It may be that strengthened muscles
                        re&shy;lease substances that migrate to the brain and stim&shy;ulate
                        ben&shy;e&shy;ficial changes there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Or weight train&shy;ing, in improving walking ability, may af&shy;fect
                        portions of the brain related to move&shy;ment that in turn somehow slow
                        the brain’s loss of white mat&shy;ter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What&shy;ev&shy;er the rea&shy;son, exercise, including weight
                        train&shy;ing, clearly <q>has ben&shy;efit for the brain</q>,
                        Dr. Liu-Ambrose said.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <q>Howev&shy;er we are just re&shy;ally now gain&shy;ing an
